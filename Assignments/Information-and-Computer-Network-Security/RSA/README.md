- You will have to use Fermatâ€™s Primality Test to check the primality of the numbers chosen in the running.
- Message will be entered Alphabetic and you are going to covert it using ASCII table.
- You have to show every step results in the CLI as shown in the test case.
- You should decrypt the message and get the original one in Alphabetic format.
- You will find a test case file in the attachment.
- You don't have to implement the whole ASCII table just mentioned in the attached file (A -> Z).
- The CRT will be bonus if implemented in the decryption "BONUS".
