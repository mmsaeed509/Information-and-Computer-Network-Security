For m = T
The encryption of m = 84 is c = 84^3 % 25777  = 25610
The decryption of c = 25610 is m = 25610^16971 % 25777 = 84
For m = E
The encryption of m = 84 is c = 69^3 % 25777  = 19185
The decryption of c = 19185 is m = 19185^16971 % 25777 = 69
For m = S
The encryption of m = 84 is c = 83^3 % 25777  = 4693
The decryption of c = 4693 is m = 4693^16971 % 25777 = 83
For m = T
The encryption of m = 84 is c = 84^3 % 25777  = 25610
The decryption of c = 25610 is m = 25610^16971 % 25777 = 84
